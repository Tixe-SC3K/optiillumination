# OptiIllumination (Optimized Illumination) [optiIllumanition]


**OptiIllumination** is an optimized, high-performance fork of the popular Minetest illumination mod. It uses position caching and a throttled globalstep to significantly **reduce CPU load** while maintaining identical visual functionality.

**Functionality:**
Makes players emit light while holding any luminescent item. The amount of light emitted equals the brightness of the item. Luminescent armor is also supported when [`3d_armor`](https://github.com/minetest-mods/3d_armor) is installed.

**Repository:**
The source code is available here: **https://github.com/Tixe-SC3K/optiillumination/**

**Credits and Origin:**
* This mod is based on the original **Illumination** mod.
* Original Author: **"Piezo\_"** (Copyright 2018).
* Fork Author and Optimization: **Tixe** (Copyright 2025).
